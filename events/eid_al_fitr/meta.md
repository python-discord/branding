**Eid al-Fitr**

[Eid al-Fitr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr) is celebrated after a month-long dawn-to-sunset fasting of Ramadan. It falls on the first day of [Shawwal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawwal) in the Islamic calendar, which will change from year to year in the Gregorian calendar depending on when the new moon is sighted. The duration of this celebration also varies from culture to culture.

During Eid, Muslims will feast on delicious foods, perform special prayers, and pass around food and drink in mosques. Wish them well by greeting them with "Eid Mubarak" during this celebration!
